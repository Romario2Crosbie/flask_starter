# flask_starter
Starter code for a new Flask Application
for the life of me I cannot get this database to connect so I had to create a database manually also when I flask db upgrade it deletes the database

Remember to always create a virtual environment and install the packages in your requirements file

```bash
$ python -m venv venv (you may need to use python3 instead)
$ source venv/bin/activate (or .\venv\Scripts\activate on Windows)
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ flask --app app --debug run
```
